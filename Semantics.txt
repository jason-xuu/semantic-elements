Semantic elements in HTML are special tags that give meaning to the content they cover or “wrap around”. 
Unlike generic tags like “div” or “span”, semantic elements provide clarity and structure to web pages by describing the purpose of the contained content. 
For instance, instead of using “divs” for headers, we can use special semantic tags like “nav” or “header”, which convey their built-in function to both browsers and developers. 
Semantics make our code more accessible and understandable, both to browsers and developers.
